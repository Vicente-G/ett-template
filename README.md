# ETÂ² Stack

Hello nerd, this is my minimalist stack to build React Native apps, it uses Expo, Typescript and Tamagui. It has some configurations of my liking, so, if anything seems off to you, please contact me via PR, I'm open to criticism and ideas to keep a fast workflow with minimum "non coding interaction", so I can deliver quickly and good software.
